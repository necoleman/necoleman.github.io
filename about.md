## About me

Welcome! I am a mathematician by training and a data scientist by trade.

## What this blog is

I read various interesting books and articles in the course of work and life. To help me digest them, I react by writing reviews. I also work on projects from time to time, including software applications, numerical simulations, and little things in sandbox games. So I document all of that here as well.

## About this blog's code

It is an implementation of [Centrarium](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/centrarium). Centrarium is a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog. Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).
