# Polya's eigenvalue conjecture is false for spheres

In my dissertation, I dedicated a section to the study of how a sphere's Laplace eigenvalue spectrum relates to its asymptotic estimate.

Later, I expanded the technique to obtain more comprehensive results, showing that every sphere has eigenvalues that fall both above and below the function that provides the asymptotic estimate of the eigenvalue spectrum.
