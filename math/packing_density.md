# Packing density

This is the first paper I wrote. I was playing around with estimating a triangle's spectrum by tiling it with smaller copies of itself, when I stumbled upon a result of George Polya. It occurred to me that one could use the same method to estimate the spectrum of a shape in terms of how much space the shape fills.

So I wrote the below. After uploading, I learned there was an earlier paper of Urakawa that accomplished much of the same result using lattices. This paper contains only a small improvement for shapes like tetrahedra that fill space much more efficiently when they are not arrayed in a lattice.

You can find the paper on [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07346) on the ArXiv.
