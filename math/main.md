# Math

My advisor was [Chris Judge](https://cjudge.pages.iu.edu) at Indiana University. I defended my [dissertation](dissertation.html) in December 2017.

While academia wasn't the right fit for my career, I still enjoy thinking about and trying to keep up with the subfield of math I studied in graduate school, spectral geometry.

Notes that I've written:
- [Laplace Subspectrality](dissertation.html), my dissertation
- [Bounding eigenvalues with packing density](packing_density.html)
- [Polya's conjecture is false for spheres](spheres.html)

Here's a brief introduction to spectral geometry. I've pitched it to a background in linear algebra and multivariable calculus, but knowing functional analysis wouldn't hurt.
