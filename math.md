# Math

In grad school, I studied spectral geometry: The relationship between the geometry of a space and the frequencies of its resonant modes.

My advisor was [Chris Judge](https://cjudge.pages.iu.edu) at Indiana University. I defended my [dissertation](math/dissertation.html) in December 2017. I still enjoy thinking about math.

Things that I've written:
- [Laplace Subspectrality](math/dissertation.html), my dissertation
- [Bounding eigenvalues with packing density](math/packing_density.html)
- [Polya's conjecture is false for spheres](math/spheres.html)

Here's a brief introduction to spectral geometry. I've pitched it to a background in linear algebra and multivariable calculus, but knowing functional analysis wouldn't hurt.
