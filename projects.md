# Projects

This is a selection of projects I've worked on.

## fepy

This is a small finite element library I created to solve eigenvalue problems on planar domains. I used it for some numerical studies in my graduate studies.

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/necoleman/fepy).

## Dodge the Planets

When I was first learning to program, I made a client-side javascript game: [Dodge the Planets](https://github.com/necoleman/dodge_the_planets)
