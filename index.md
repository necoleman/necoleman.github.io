# Welcome!

My name's Neal. This page has my professional profile, some of the projects I've worked on, some of the activities I enjoy, and some thoughts on various topics of interest.

## About me

I'm a mathematician by training, a data scientist by trade. I have worked as a data scientist in property & casualty insurance and healthcare technology, in small companies and Fortune 100 companies. Before data science, I taught math (from prealgebra to calculus) to college students during graduate school. In math, I have also written a handful of unpublished papers and given talks.

Born and bred a Hoosier, I've adopted Chicagoland. I live in Evanston, Illinois with my wife, two kids, and big dork of a dog.

### In my work, I... 

lead scientists and engineers in the Incubation Lab at The Hartford. We wrk to find new technology solutions to business problems and  measure their potential value. We have studied data products, evaluated technology vendors, and built proofs of concept and deployed them to production.

In previous lives, I've... 
- Been the only data professional at Dina, a healthtech startup, where I owned the full data stack, from third party data and production ETL all the way to customer analytics, company KPIs, and building a predictive model deployment platform
- Been a data scientist at Allstate, where I ran the analytics for America's Best Drivers for three years straight and developed the first Shared Mobility product offering at the subsidiary Arity
- Studied global harmonic analysis
- Taught and tutored college math in graduate school

### I also... 

Volunteer around town with scouting and chess. I'm a founding board member of two community groups, Evanston Scholastic Chess and Citizens of Evanston for Scouting.

I enjoy camping, hiking, boating, biking, board games like chess and Axis & Allies, and computer games like Victoria 3, Kerbal Space Program, and Cities Skylines.

I like to keep my hands busy with calligraphy, painting, wood carving, and crafting.

I play the viola. Currently, I'm slowly relearning Brandenburg 6.

I read books about science fiction, fantasy, history, and politics.

I like to think about world building, geography and economics, mathematics, and numerical scientific modeling.

My proudest accomplishments, in order of importance, are: My two kids, somehow getting my wife to say "yes" to marry me, earning a PhD, and earning Eagle Scout.
